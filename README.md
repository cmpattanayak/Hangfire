# Scheduling Jobs with ASP.Net Core and Hangfire
## Overview
Hangfire provides an easy way to perform background processing in .NET and .NET Core applications. No Windows Service or separate process required.
It is backed by persistent storage. Background jobs are created in a persistent storage â€“ SQL Server, Redis, PostgreSQL, MongoDB etc. 
You can safely restart your application and use Hangfire with ASP.NET without worrying about application pool recycles.
Hangfire is open and free for commercial use.
## What I have used in this project
1. Asp.Net Core 3.1
2. Hangfire 1.7.x (Following Nuget Packages)
   - Hangfire.AspNetCore
   - Hangfire.SqlServer
   - Hangfire.Console
3. I have used Sql Server for Storage
## Job Types
  - Fire and forget job (are executed only once and almost immediately after creation, can be triggered on certain events)
  - Delayed jobs (are executed only once too, but not immediately, after a certain time interval) 
  - Recurring jobs (recurring jobs fire many times on the specified CRON schedule)
  - Continuations (are executed when its parent job has been finished)
 ## Scheduler Components
 1. **Server** - 
 It is the most important component of Hangfire Schedulers. It has to run continuously, so when time comes, it will execute specific job(s).
 A console application can fulfill this requirement.
 2. **Client (Optional)** - 
 If you have to configure a fire and forget job which need to be triggered on some events (say a button click), you may need a clicent application which can be built on anything.
 3. **Dashboard (Optional)** - 
 If you want to monitor job related activities like how many jobs have succeeded/failed or in process or if you want to log stepwise execution progress, you may require a dashboard.
 This has to be a web application (in this case Asp.Net Core Web Application).
 ### What is common in these three components 
 You might be thinking how these three apps are interlinked to each other. Well, the answer is the Sql Server connection. 
 You need to provide the same Sql Server connection string in each of these applications.
